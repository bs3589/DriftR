#DriftR

[DriftR deployed app](https://driftr-app.herokuapp.com/)

For this project, our group made an app where users can share fun things to do in their favorite cities.  Users can go to different cities where they can see a picture of the city, and other users' shared posts. These posts are ideas of fun things you can do in that particular city.  A user can sign up and create posts to share things they like to do in that city also.  A user can also delete, edit, and view these posts.  In addition to posting, users can comment on other peoples' posts.  When a post is viewed, all comments for that post can be seen.
